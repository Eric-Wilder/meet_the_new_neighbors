## Description
The COVID-19 pandemic is an obstacle for many social activities in our lives.  The ‘**Meet The New Neighbor**’ app allows each participant to introduce themselves, and their family members to others within their community.  The Home Owners Association or apartment manager can provide them with a link to the app.  The user inputs specific details such as contact information, interests, hobbies, pets, etc..  They can also view the details of others, and schedule activities with those having similar interests. 
____
## User_Story:
AS individuals or families move to a new neighborhood or apartment complex   
THEY want to meet other neighbors within their community or building.   
WHEN they are presented with an app that provides personal details of other neighbors,   
THEY can contact them to schedule events of similar interest.
____
## Installation 
(1) Go to the root folder in VS Code, right-click, select **Open in Integrated Terminal** and type: **npm i** (install) which will install all required dependencies for the app, creating the **node modules** folders and **package-lock.json** files for the client and server side.   
(2) Type **npm run seed** to initialize the MongoDB database (familyList).   
(3) Type **npm start** to invoke the App.     
(4) The App will automatically open a webpage on **localhost:3000**, displaying the **Meet The New Neighbors** App on the Client side (front end).  The Server side (back end) will be running on **localhost:3001**.

## Usage 
This App allows new members of a community to introduce themselves to others in that community without making direct contact.  When the App is opened, the User must **Log In** to add or view community resident information. They have the ability to **Log In** or **Sign Up** and create an account with Auth0, or **Continue with Google** if they have a Google account.   
After logging in, they can enter details about themselves and their family on the left side of the display.
